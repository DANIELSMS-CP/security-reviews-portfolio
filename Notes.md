## Question(s)

1. When a protocol gives you only an Etherscan link, what do you think should be your next step?

> You don't audit it. If the creator insists, then it is the proof that they don't want to be safer. You can charge them extra money to make the codebase more mature.

2. Should we review a codebase again?
